	//Down Casting is not possible in Compile tie itself cox ...
		//Downcasting is creating a Parent Interface Object using Child Class object reference variable 
		//so as per logic iterface cannot create object so downcasting is possible at Mutiple Inheritance 
	
	
		//Note: An Interface can have Parent Interface and not Parent class

		//Keywords to use for calling 
		
		//Class to Class we need to use-- extends
		//Class to interface-- implements
		//interface to interface ---extends 
		//interface to class---not possible
		

		
		
		//In Interface variables are static and Final by default 
		//eg.int fee=100;
		
		//the methods in Interface is caslled Abstract method 
		//i.e A method which doesnt have method body 
		//also called Prototype Method
		//we canot write static or final in Interface method because interface methods are always overridden in the child class
