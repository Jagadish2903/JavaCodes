		//What is Selenium?
		
		//Selenium is not a testing tool its just an api or libraries tat used to automate web applications
		//for validating we need to use in the form of codeing or TestNg etc
		//Selenium Automate only browsers
		//Selenium supports multiple language bindings (Java/C#/python/javascript..etc)
		//Supports cross browsers as well(chrome/firefox/safari..etc)
		//supports different platforms (windows/mac/linux)
		//Selenium doesnt not support Desktop application(Teams/telegram/torrent etcc)
		//Can do Performance testing but not recommended since it is not optimized for that (Jmeter/loader/getLink ..etc can be used for tat)
		//mobile apps cannot be automated with only selenium (Appium is used for that and which has some selenium libraries)
		
		//Competitor for selenium is Cyprus but for cyprus it accepts only Javascript
		
		//Selenium is a open-source and free 
		//we can create a new tool with Java or any language with selenium libraries 
		
		
		//Four Parts of Selenium
		//1.Selenium IDE --Its record and play 
		//2.Selenium RC--Remote control --its called Selenium 1
		//3.Selenium WebDriver---Selenium 2 
		//4.Selenium Grid ---used to execute the webdriver script on different platforms and diff browsers 
		        //its lyk hub wen we write script and want to execute in multiple browsers and multiple platforms we use Selenium Grid 
		
		
		//In Java Project we cannot use Selenium libraries along with Java libraries so we need to use Maven Project for this
